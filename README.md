# freshstarsh
A script to setup a fresh install of Ubuntu to my taste.

THIS SCRIPT IS STILL UNTESTED RUN IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

If you need a tutorial on how to run this script, I recommend you skip this, because there is a very real chance of bricking your machine.

Functionality of this script has only been partially tested.
